\title{Cosine Similarity}
\usage{
corCosine(x, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix where columns represent vectors}

\item{y}{Optional second numeric matrix for cross-correlation. If NULL,
computes self-correlation of x}
}
\value{
Cosine similarity matrix. For self-correlation, returns a symmetric
matrix; for cross-correlation, returns a matrix with dimensions
ncol(x) × ncol(y)
}
\description{
corCosine computes cosine similarity between vectors or matrices.
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between vectors,
providing a scale-invariant measure of similarity.
}
\details{
Cosine similarity is calculated as:
cos(θ) = (x·y) / (||x|| * ||y||)

This measure is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Text analysis (TF-IDF vectors)
\item Recommendation systems
\item High-dimensional data where magnitude is less important than direction
}

The function handles zero vectors gracefully by setting their norm to 1,
preventing division by zero.

\examples{
# Self-correlation (symmetric matrix)
x <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
cos_sim_self <- corCosine(x)
print(cos_sim_self)

# Cross-correlation
y <- matrix(c(2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
cos_sim_cross <- corCosine(x, y)
print(cos_sim_cross)

# With zero vectors
z <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
cos_sim_zero <- corCosine(z)
print(cos_sim_zero)
