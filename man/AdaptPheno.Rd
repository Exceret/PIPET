\usage{
AdaptPheno(
  phenotype,
  discretize_method = c("kmeans", "median", "custom"),
  cutoff = NULL,
  phenotype_type = c("binary", "continuous", "survival"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype}{A named numeric vector (for \code{"binary"} or \code{"continuous"})
or a data frame with columns \code{time} and \code{status} (for \code{"survival"}).
\itemize{
\item For \code{"binary"}: values should be 0/1 (or equivalent); exactly two unique values required.
\item For \code{"continuous"}: numeric values; must have >2 unique values unless explicitly declared binary.
\item For \code{"survival"}: a data frame where \code{rownames} are sample IDs, and \code{status} is 0/1.
}}

\item{discretize_method}{\code{c("median", "kmeans", "custom")}. Discretization
strategy for continuous phenotypes. Note: \code{"median"} is mapped internally to
\code{"quantile"} (2-group quantile split). Default: \code{"kmeans"}.}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric vector of length \code{n_group - 1}. Required only when
\code{discretize_method = "custom"}. Defines interior breakpoints on the
\emph{normalized, log2-transformed scale} (i.e., after \code{scale(log2(x + 1))}).
Must be sorted in ascending order.}

\item{phenotype_type}{\code{c("binary", "continuous", "survival")}. If missing or
length > 1, auto-detection is attempted:}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused, reserved for future extension).}
}
\value{
A two-column \code{data.frame}:
\describe{
\item{sample}{Sample IDs (from \code{names(phenotype)})}
\item{class}{Discrete class labels as a factor. For binary phenotypes:
\code{"group_1"} (value == 1) and \code{"group_0"} (value != 1). For continuous:
\code{"group_1"}, \code{"group_2"}, ..., ordered by increasing mean of normalized
phenotype within group (for \code{"kmeans"}), or by quantile/custom interval.}
}
}
\description{
Converts a named numeric phenotype vector into a standardized data frame with
discrete class labels. Supports both binary, continuous, and survival phenotypes.

For continuous phenotypes, performs automatic discretization based on the
specified method (e.g., quantile-based, k-means clustering, or custom cutoffs).
Internally applies log2(x+1) transformation and z-scoring before discretization
to stabilize variance and improve cluster separation.
}
\section{Notes}{

\itemize{
\item Binary phenotype validation: exactly two unique values required; if more,
use \code{phenotype_type = "continuous"}.
\item Continuous phenotype with only two unique values will error — explicitly
declare as binary in such edge cases (e.g., dichotomized lab values).
\item Discretization is performed on \code{scale(log2(phenotype + 1))} to
ensure robustness for skewed genomic/clinical data (e.g., gene expression,
biomarker levels). Cutoffs must be specified on this transformed scale.
