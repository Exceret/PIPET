\title{Correlation Calculation Function}
\usage{
corFun(x, y, distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{First numeric matrix (features × samples)}

\item{y}{Second numeric matrix (features × samples)}

\item{distance}{Correlation method to use. Options include:
\itemize{
\item "cosine": Cosine similarity (scale-invariant)
\item "pearson": Pearson correlation (linear relationship)
\item "spearman": Spearman correlation (rank-based)
\item "kendall": Kendall correlation (rank-based, more robust)
}}
}
\value{
A correlation function that can be applied to compute similarities
between the input matrices
}
\description{
Creates a correlation function for computing similarities between matrices using
either cosine similarity or standard correlation methods.
}
\details{
This function returns an appropriate correlation function based on the specified
distance metric. For cosine similarity, it uses the optimized corCosine function;
for other methods, it returns the corresponding correlation function from R's
stats::cor function.

Cosine similarity is particularly useful when the magnitude of vectors is less
important than their direction, such as in text analysis or recommendation systems.
Pearson correlation measures linear relationships, while Spearman and Kendall
correlations are rank-based and more robust to outliers.

\examples{
# Create example matrices
x <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
y <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 3), nrow = 100, ncol = 3)

# Get cosine similarity 
cosine_similarity <- corFun(x, y, distance = "cosine")

# Get Pearson correlation 
pearson_cor <- corFun(x, y, distance = "pearson")
