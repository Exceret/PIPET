\title{Distance Calculation Between Matrices}
\usage{
disFun(x, y, distance, n_levels = 2L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{First numeric matrix (features × samples)}

\item{y}{Second numeric matrix (features × samples)}

\item{distance}{Distance metric to use. Common options include:
\itemize{
\item "euclidean": Euclidean distance
\item "manhattan": Manhattan distance
\item "maximum": Maximum distance
\item "canberra": Canberra distance
\item "binary": Binary distance
\item "minkowski": Minkowski distance
}}

\item{n_levels}{Number of distance values to return. Typically the number of
columns in the smaller matrix or a specified subset.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of distances between corresponding columns of x and y
}
\description{
Computes pairwise distances between columns of two matrices using specified
distance metrics. Useful for comparing feature distributions or sample similarities.
}
\details{
This function combines the columns of both matrices and computes a distance matrix
using R's built-in dist function, then extracts the relevant pairwise distances
between columns of x and y.

The function is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Comparing gene expression profiles between different conditions
\item Measuring similarity between single-cell and bulk expression patterns
\item Feature selection based on distribution differences
}
}
\examples{
# Create example matrices
x <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
y <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)

# Compute Euclidean distances between corresponding columns
distances <- disFun(x, y, distance = "euclidean", n_levels = 5)
print(distances)

# Compute Manhattan distances
manhattan_dists <- disFun(x, y, distance = "manhattan", n_levels = 5)
print(manhattan_dists)
