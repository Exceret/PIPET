\title{Distance and Correlation Conversion Functions}
\usage{
DistToCor(x)

CorToDist(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector or matrix of correlation coefficients (-1 to 1)}
}
\value{
Correlation coefficients ranging from -1 to 1

Euclidean distances (non-negative values)
}
\description{
Utility functions for converting between distance metrics and correlation measures.
These functions are useful for data preprocessing and similarity calculations.

DistToCor converts squared Euclidean distances to correlation coefficients.
Assumes data has been normalized to unit variance.

CorToDist converts correlation coefficients to Euclidean distances.
Useful for converting correlation matrices to distance matrices for clustering.
}
\details{
The conversion formula is: correlation = 1 - 2 * distance^2
This assumes that the input distances are squared Euclidean distances
computed from standardized data (mean 0, variance 1).

The conversion formula is: distance = sqrt(0.5 * (1 - correlation))
This produces Euclidean distances that are compatible with most
distance-based algorithms.

\examples{
# Convert squared distances to correlations
distances <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 1)
correlations <- DistToCor(distances)
print(correlations)

# Convert correlations to distances
correlations <- c(1, 0.5, 0, -0.5, -1)
distances <- CorToDist(correlations)
print(distances)
